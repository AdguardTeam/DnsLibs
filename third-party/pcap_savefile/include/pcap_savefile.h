 * The first record in the file contains saved values for some
 * of the flags used in the printout phases of tcpdump.
 * Many fields here are 32 bit ints so compilers won't insert unwanted
 * padding; these files need to be interchangeable across architectures.
 *
 * Do not change the layout of this structure, in any way (this includes
 * changes that only affect the length of fields in this structure).
 *
 * Also, do not change the interpretation of any of the members of this
 * structure, in any way (this includes using values other than
 * LINKTYPE_ values, as defined in "savefile.c", in the "linktype"
 * field).
 *
 * Instead:
 *
 *	introduce a new structure for the new format, if the layout
 *	of the structure changed;
 *
 *	send mail to "tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org", requesting
 *	a new magic number for your new capture file format, and, when
 *	you get the new magic number, put it in "savefile.c";
 *
 *	use that magic number for save files with the changed file
 *	header;
 *
 *	make the code in "savefile.c" capable of reading files with
 *	the old file header as well as files with the new file header
 *	(using the magic number to determine the header format).
 *
 * Then supply the changes by forking the branch at
 *
 *	https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/issues
 *
 * and issuing a pull request, so that future versions of libpcap and
 * programs that use it (such as tcpdump) will be able to read your new
 * capture file format.
