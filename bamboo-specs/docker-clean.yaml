# Well, we have a little interesting problem with docker and bamboo.
# Imagine the following situation:
# - A Bamboo agent with user 'agent1' checkouts a git repo;
# - The agent runs a docker container with user 'root', which creates a file in the same directory as the git repo exists;
#
# After this, the agent tries to clean a directory, but it can't because a different user created a file to the git repo.
# To workaround this behavior, we just remove the root directory from the docker itself.
#
# Second line is workaround for how Docker mounts volumes.
# If volume doesn't exist then it is automatically created by Docker and owned by root.#
# Bamboo agent periodically cleans its git cache, and when no repositories left, deletes "${bamboo.git.cache.directory}".
# After that, any task with volume "${bamboo.git.cache.directory}" will force Docker to create it with wrong permissions.
# Solution is to chmod this directory if it is owned by root.
script:
  - |-
    rm -rf *
    if [ -O "${bamboo.git.cache.directory}" ]; then chmod 0777 "${bamboo.git.cache.directory}"; fi
